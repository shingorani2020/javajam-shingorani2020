# Part 4 Challenge


1. Use your previous JavaJam project as your starter file. 

2. Create a directory called "images". Move all image files into that directory.

3. Create a directory called "css". Move the javajam.css file into that directory.

4. Modify the links to the stylesheet in all html files so that they can locate the javajam.css file.

5. Remove the `<i><small>` tags from the footer in all html files.

6. Add style rules to the footer style definition in the stylesheet to produce the same effect as the 
tags removed in step 5. To achieve the same effect using CSS you'll need [font-style](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-style.asp) and [font-size](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-size.asp)

7. Now make the images look like the pictures below. Remember, all references to image files must have the 
correct path:  path/filename. All image files are located by the path:  images/filename, relative
to the html pages.
